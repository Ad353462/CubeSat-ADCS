After running Extended_Kalman_Filter.cpp while test is #defined, x_hat_kk_cpp.txt will be generated. 
Move this file to the Testing folder and it will be used as an input to the MATLAB files EKF_with_gyro_drv_w_cpp_test.ml and EKF_cpp_ver_plot.ml to generate plots of the resulting x_hat data against desired data from desired.txt.

EKF_with_gyro_drv_w_cpp_test.ml runs the original algorithm created by Dr.Bauer and plots x_hat_kk generated by the MATLAB version against desired data and the data from x_hat_kk_cpp.txt in the same graphs (the differences between MATLAB and C++ versions were very small and require zooming).
EKF_cpp_ver_plot.ml simply plots x_hat_kk_cpp.txt against desired data.
